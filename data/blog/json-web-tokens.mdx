## Introduction

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open standard that specifies a compact and self-contained method for securely transmitting information between parties.
JWTs are a type of token that can be utilized across multiple servers. They are akin to wristbands, allowing security personnel to easily identify individuals.
JWTs are often used for API authentication, providing a single authorization that enables users to access the API multiple times.

- Secure
- Stateless
- Compact
- Flexible

## Session tokens

Session tokens are encrypted strings used to identify a session between two parties.
Consider a scenario where a user logs into a website and needs to be identified.
The user is given a session token, which is stored in the server's memory.
This token allows the server to identify the user and retrieve their data from the database.
The session token is stored in the client's browser cookies.

## JWT vs Session tokens

JWT and session tokens are both used to authenticate users, but they have some key differences.

| JWT                                 | Session tokens                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Can be used across multiple servers | Can only be used on a single server |
| More secure                         | Less secure                         |
| More flexible                       | Less flexible                       |

## Structure

A JWT is composed of three parts separated by dots:

- Header (Algorithm and token type)
- Payload (claims/data)
- Signature (encoded header and payload)

These parts are encoded in a format called Base64, which turns data into a string thatâ€™s easy to send over the internet.
