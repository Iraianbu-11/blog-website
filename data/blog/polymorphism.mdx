## Introduction

**Polymorphism** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects, enabling **flexibilty,
scalability and code resue**.

## Benefits

- **Code Reusability** : Allows the same class or methods to be used with different objects.
- **Flexibility** : Object of different classes to be treated as objects of common superclass.
- **Abstraction** : Simplifies the interaction with objects.
- **Dynamic Behavior** : giving the program dynamic behavior based on the actual object type rather than the reference type.

## Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Method Overloading).
2. **Run-time Polymorphism** (Method Overriding).

## Compile-Time Polymorphism

**Compile-time polymorphism** is also known as **static polymorphism** and also know as **method overloading**.
It occurs when multiple methods in the same class share the same name but have different method signatures (parameters). The method to be called is determined at **compile time**.

### Java

```java
class ConsoleOperation {
    public void print(int number) {
        System.out.println(number);
    }

    public void print(String text) {
        System.out.println(text);
    }

    public void print(int number, String text) {
        System.out.println(number + " " + text);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        ConsoleOperation consoleOperation = new ConsoleOperation();
        consoleOperation.print(10);
        consoleOperation.print("Hello");
        consoleOperation.print(10, "Hello");
    }
```

#### Output

```
10
Hello
10 Hello
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Java does not support operator overloading.

## Run-Time Polymorphism

**Run-time polymorphism** is also known as **Dynamic Method Dispatch** and also know as **method overriding**.
It occurs when a method is overridden in a subclass. The method to be called is determined at **run time**.

### Java

```java
class Sport {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Sport is played");
    }
}

class Football extends Sport {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Football is played");
    }
}

class Cricket extends Sport {
    @Override
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("Cricket is played");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Sport sport = new Football(); // Upcasting
        sport.display();

        sport = new Cricket(); // Dynamic method dispatch
        sport.display();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Football is played
Cricket is played
```

> [!NOTE]
> Upcasting (or widening) is the typecasting from a subclass to a superclass (Child to Parent class). <br/>Downcasting (or narrowing) is the typecasting from a superclass to a subclass (Parent to Child class).

## Polymorphism with Interfaces

Polymorphism is widely used with interfaces, allowing multiple classes to share a common contract.

### Java

```java
interface Payment{
    void pay();
}

class CreditCardPayment implements Payment{
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment done using credit card: " + amount);
    }
}

class DebitCardPayment implements Payment{
    @Override
    public void pay(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Payment done using debit card: " + amount);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Payment payment = new CreditCardPayment();
        payment.pay(100.00);

        payment = new DebitCardPayment();
        payment.pay(200.0);
    }
}


```

#### Output

```
Payment done using credit card: 100.0
Payment done using debit card: 200.0
```
