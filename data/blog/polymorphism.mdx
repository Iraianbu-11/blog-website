## Introduction

**Polymorphism** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It allows a single interface to be used for different types of objects, enabling **flexibilty,
scalability and code resue**.

## Benefits

- **Code Reusability** : Allows the same class or methods to be used with different objects.
- **Flexibility** : Object of different classes to be treated as objects of common superclass.
- **Abstraction** : Simplifies the interaction with objects.
- **Dynamic Behavior** : giving the program dynamic behavior based on the actual object type rather than the reference type.

## Types of Polymorphism

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism** (Method Overloading).
2. **Run-time Polymorphism** (Method Overriding).
