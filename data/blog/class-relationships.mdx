## Introduction

In this article, we'll explore all kinds of relationships in object-oriented design using **Java** with real-life examples

## Types of Class Relationships

### Inheritance

Please refer to [Inheritance](./inheritance) for more details.

### Association

Association is a general relationship where one class knows about or uses another class.
They can exist independently of each other.

> [!NOTE]
> Association represents **USES-A** relationship.

#### Types of Association

1. **Unidirectional Association**
   One class knows about another class but the other class doesn't know about the first class.
   (Example : A `Person` knows about a `Car` but a `Car` doesn't know about a `Person`.)

2. **Bidirectional Association**
   The classes are aware of each other and can interact with each other.
   (Example : A `Library` has many `Books` and a `Book` belongs to a `Library`.)

3. **One-to-One Association**
   Each object of class A is associated with one object of class B.
   (Example : A `Person` has a single `Passport`.)

4. **One-to-Many Association**
   Each object of class A is associated with many objects of class B.
   (Example : A `Teacher` has many `Students`.)

5. **Many-to-One Association**
   Many objects of class A is associated with one object of class B.
   (Example : Multiple `Students` belongs to one `Department`.)

6. **Many-to-Many Association**
   Many objects of class A is associated with many objects of class B.
   (Example : Multiple `Students` can have multiple `Teachers`.)

```java
class Car{
    private String model;
    Car(String model ){
        this.model = model;
    }

    void drive(){
        System.out.println("Driving a " + model + " car");
    }
}

class Person{
    private String name;
    private Car car;
    Person(String name , Car car){
        this.name = name;
        this.car = car;
    }
    void drive(){
        System.out.println(name + " is driving a " + car.getModel() + " car");
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Car car = new Car("Koenigsegg");
        Person person = new Person("Iraianbuu", car);
        person.drive();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Iraianbuu is driving a Koenigsegg car
```

- `Person` has a reference to `Car`.
- Both `Car` and `Person` can exist independently.

### Aggregation

Aggregation is a weak form of association in OOP where an object of one class contains a reference to an object of another class.
However, the contained object can exist independently of the container.
This means that even if the container object is destroyed, the contained object can still be used elsewhere in the application.

> [!NOTE]
> Aggregation represents **HAS-A** relationship.

#### Real-life Examples

1. `Zoo` - `Animals` (Zoo has many animals but animals can be transferred to other zoos.)
2. `Library` - `Books` (Library has many books but books can be transferred to other libraries.)
3. `Hospital` - `Doctors` (Hospital has many doctors but doctors can work in other hospitals.)

```java
class Professor {
    private String name;
    private String subject;

    public Professor(String name, String subject) {
        this.name = name;
        this.subject = subject;
    }

    public void teach() {
        System.out.println(name + " is teaching " + subject);
    }
}

class University {
    private String universityName;
    private List<Professor> professors;

    public University(String universityName) {
        this.universityName = universityName;
        this.professors = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addProfessor(Professor professor) {
        professors.add(professor);
    }

    public void showProfessors() {
        System.out.println("Professors at " + universityName + ":");
        for (Professor professor : professors) {
            System.out.println(" - " + professor.name);
        }
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Professor virat = new Professor("Dr. Virat Kohli", "Java");
        Professor rohit = new Professor("Dr. Rohit Sharma", "Python");

        University university = new University("NIT Trichy");
        university.addProfessor(virat);
        university.addProfessor(rohit);

        university.showProfessors();

        // Professors can exist independently
        virat.teach();
        rohit.teach();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Professors at NIT Trichy:
 - Dr. Virat Kohli
 - Dr. Rohit Sharma

Dr. Virat Kohli is teaching Java
Dr. Rohit Sharma is teaching Python
```

### Composition

Composition is a strong form of association in OOP where an object of one class contains a reference to an object of another class.
If the container object is destroyed, the contained object is also destroyed.
The contained class is often called a component, and the containing class is referred to as a composite class.

> [!NOTE]
> Composition represents **HAS-A** / **PART-OF** relationship.

#### Real-life Examples

1. `Car` - `Engine` (A car has an engine but the engine can't exist without a car.)
2. `House` - `Rooms` (A house has many rooms but rooms can't exist without a house.)
3. `Human` - `Heart` (A human has a heart but the heart can't exist without a human.)

```java
class Engine{
    private String type;
    Engine(String type){
        this.type = type;
    }
    void start(){
        System.out.println("Engine started");
    }
}

class Car{
    private Engine engine;
    Car(Engine engine){
        this.engine = engine;
    }
    void start(){
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main{
    public static void main(String... args){
        Engine engine = new Engine("V8");
        Car car = new Car(engine);
        car.start();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Engine started
```

### Dependency

Dependency is a relationship where one class uses another class.

```java
class Printer {
  void print(String message) {
    System.out.println("Printing: " + message);
  }
}

class Document {
  String content;
  Document(String content) {
    this.content = content;
  }
  // Dependency: Document uses Printer to print its content.
  void printDocument(Printer printer) {
    printer.print(content);
  }
}

public class DependencyDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Document doc = new Document("Hello, World!");
    Printer printer = new Printer();
    doc.printDocument(printer);
  }
}

```

#### Output

```
Printing: Hello, World!
```

## Association vs Aggregation vs Composition

| Object Lifecycle | Independent                | Independent                             | Dependent                                                     |
| Lifetime         | Object exist independently | Container object outlives the container | Contained object is destroyed when the container is destroyed |
| Example          | `Teacher` and `Student`    | `University` and `Professor`            | `Car` and `Engine`                                            |
