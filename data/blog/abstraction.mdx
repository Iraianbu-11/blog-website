## Introduction

**Abstraction** is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential details or features to the user.

Abstraction is achieved by using **abstract classes** and **interfaces**.

## Key features

- Hides the complex and shows only essential features.
- Makes code easier to understand and maintain.
- Protects internal details from external interference.

## Key differences

| Feature              | Abstract Classes                                             | Interfaces                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Methods              | Abstract classes can have abstract and non-abstract methods. | Interfaces can only have abstract methods.            |
| Constructor          | Abstract classes can have constructors.                      | Interfaces cannot have constructors.                  |
| Fields               | Abstract classes can have instance variables.                | Interfaces cannot have instance variables.            |
| Multiple Inheritance | Abstract classes can have instance variables.                | Interfaces cannot have public static final variables. |
| Access Modifiers     | Can have difference access modifiers                         | Interfaces can only have public methods.              |

## Abstraction using abstract classes

Abstract classes are classes that are declared with the `abstract` keyword.
It provides partial abstraction.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    String name;
    Vehicle(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    abstract void start();
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Vehicle: " + name);
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    Car(String name) {
        super(name);
    }
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car("Koenigsegg Agera");
        car.start();
        car.display();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Car started
Vehicle: Koenigsegg Agera
```

## Abstraction using interfaces

Interfaces are abstract types that define a set of methods that a class must implement.
It provides full abstraction.

```java
interface Vehicle {
    void start();
    void display();
}

class Car implements Vehicle {
    String name;
    Car(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    @Override
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Car: " + name);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car("Koenigsegg Agera");
        car.start();
        car.display();
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Car started
Car: Koenigsegg Agera
```
