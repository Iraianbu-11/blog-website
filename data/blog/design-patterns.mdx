## Introduction

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems
in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint
that you can customize to solve a particular
design problem in your code. The idea was picked up by four authors: Erich Gamma, John Vlissides, Ralph Johnson, and Richard Helm. In 1994, they published _Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_, in which they applied the concept of design patterns to programming.

## Classification of Design Patterns

Design patterns differ by their complexity, level of
detail and scale of applicability. In addition,
they can be categorized by their intent
and divided into three groups.

- Creational patterns
- Structural patterns
- Behavioral patterns

## Creational Patterns

**Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

## Structural Patterns

**Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Behavioral Patterns

**Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
