## Introduction

SOLID is an acronym for the five principles of object-oriented design by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).
In this article, we will discuss the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and how it can be applied to Java and TypeScript.

## Single Responsibility Principle

The **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** states that a module (Set of function, classes or packages)
should be responsible to one, and only one,actor.
An actor is any individual, group, or other system that interacts with the system in a way and may call for modifications to the module.

> [!NOTE]
> A class should have one and only one reason to change

## Example in Java

Consider this Java class that violates SRP:

```java
public class Employee {
  public Money calculatePay();
  public void save();
  public String reportHours();
}
```

This class has three methods:

- `calculatePay`: Determines how much an employee should be paid based on their contract, status, and hours worked
- `save`: Stores the employee data in the enterprise database
- `reportHours`: Generates a report string for auditors to verify working hours

### The Problem

This class violates SRP because it has multiple responsibilities that would be of interest to different stakeholders:

1. The CFO's team would request changes to the `calculatePay` method
2. The HR's team would request changes to the `reportHours` method
3. The Technical team would request changes to the `save` method

If you change the `calculatePay` method and accidentally break the `reportHours` method, you've created a problem for the HR's team when they didn't request any changes.

### Better Design

Following SRP, we should separate these responsibilities:

```java
public class Employee {
  // Employee data and core functionality
}

public class PayCalculator {
  public Money calculatePay(Employee employee);
}

public class EmployeeRepository {
  public void save(Employee employee);
}

public class HourReporter {
  public String reportHours(Employee employee);
}
```

Now each class has a single responsibility and will change only when requested by its respective stakeholder.

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Changes in one responsibility won't affect other responsibilities
2. **Testability**: Easier to write focused unit tests
3. **Readability**: Classes and methods become more focused and easier to understand
4. **Reusability**: Single-responsibility components are more likely to be reusable

## Conclusion

The Single Responsibility Principle helps us create more maintainable code by separating concerns based on who might request changes.
As Uncle Bob puts it: **"Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons."**
