## Introduction

HTTP headers carries metadata about the request or response. Headers provide critical information about the HTTP communication.
Without them, web communication lack structure , security and efficiency.

## HTTP Headers

It contains key-value pairs transmitted at the beginning of HTTP requests and responses.
The header name is case-insensitive, though by convention they're often written in Pascal case (e.g., `Content-Type`).

```
Header-Name : Header-Value
```

To inspect the headers of a request, you can use the `curl` command.

```
curl -I https://www.google.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000
Server: gws

```

## Categories

### Request Headers

It is sent by the client (browser) to the server, containing information about :

- The client itself (User-Agent)
- What type of responses it will accept (Accept, Accept-Language)
- Authentication credentials (Authorization)
- Caching preferences (Cache-Control)
- Connection management (Connection)

### Response Headers

It is sent by the server to the client, containing information about :

- The server itself (Server)
- Details about the resource (Content-Type, Content-Length)
- How long the content will stay fresh (Cache-Control)
- Security policies (Content-Security-Policy)
- Cookie settings (Set-Cookie)

### Entity Headers

It describes the content being transferred.

- Content-Type
- Content-Length
- Content-Encoding
- Content-Language
- Content-Location

### General Headers

It is used for both requests and responses.

- Date
- Connection
- Cache-Control
- Transfer-Encoding

## Common HTTP Headers

### Content-Type

It specfies the media type of the resource being sent.

```
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Type: image/png
```

### Accept

It specifies the media types that the client can accept.

```
Accept: text/html
Accept: application/json
```

Client request with both header

```
POST /api/v1/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
    "name": "Iraianbu A",
    "email": "irainbu@gmail.com",
}
```

Server response :

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Authorization

It provides credentials for accessing protected resources.

```
Authorization: Basic <credentials>
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Cache-Control

It controls how caches should handle the response.

```
Cache-Control: no-store , max-age=0 // Do not cache
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600 // Cache for 1 hour
Cache-Control: private, no-cache // Cache for a private user
```

### Set-Cookie

It is used to set a cookie.

```
Set-Cookie: session=1234567890; HttpOnly; Secure; Max-Age=3600
```

> [!NOTE] > **HttpOnly**: Prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie. <br/> **Secure**: Ensures the cookie is only sent over HTTPS. <br/> **Max-Age**: Specifies the expiration time in seconds.

### CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) ensures which domains can access the resource.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization
```
