## Introduction

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

## Problem

The Singleton pattern solves two problems at the same time, violating the Single Responsibility Principle:

1. Ensure that a class has only one instance. (Database connection, Logger, File system)
2. Provide a global access point to that instance. (Global state)

## Real World Examples

1. Passport
2. Government
3. Logger
4. Database connection pool
5. Caching Mechanism

- It is also used in other design patterns like
  **Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade**, etc.

- It is used in core Java classes like **`java.lang.Runtime`** and **`java.awt.Desktop`**

## Implementation in Java

### Eager Initialization

```java
import java.io.Serializable;

/**
 * If the singleton class not using a lot of resource, we can go
 * for Eager Singleton. There is no options for exception
 * handling. Good for single threaded environment.
 */
public class EagerSingleton implements Cloneable,Serializable {
    private static final EagerSingleton instance = new EagerSingleton();

    private EagerSingleton() {
        /**
         * This is to prevent the class from being instantiated
         * using reflection.
         */
        if(instance != null){
            throw new RuntimeException("Use getInstance() method to get the instance");
        }

    }

    @Override
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        /*
         * This is to prevent the class from being cloned
         * using the clone() method.
         */
        if(instance != null){
            throw new CloneNotSupportedException("Use getInstance() method to get the instance");
        }
        return super.clone();
    }

    /**
     * This is to prevent the class from being deserialized
     * using the readObject() method.
     */
    private Object readResolve() {
        return instance;
    }

    public static EagerSingleton getInstance(){
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Static Block Initialization

### Lazy Initialization

### Thread Safe Singleton

### Double Checked Locking

### Bill Pugh Singleton

### Enum Singleton

## Advantages

- Be sure that a class has only a single instance.
- Control the global access to the instance.
- The singleton object is created only when it is needed.

## Disadvantages

- Violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Requires special handling in multithreaded environments.

## Relationship with other patterns

1. **Singleton** can be used to implement other patterns like **Abstract Factory**, **Builder**, and **Prototype**.
2. A **Facade** pattern can often be implemented as a **Singleton** when only one access point is needed.
3. **Singleton** vs **Flyweight**:
   - **Singleton**: Only one instance exists for the entire application
   - **Flyweight**: Multiple instances exist, each with different internal states
   - **Singleton** objects can be changed (mutable), while **Flyweight** objects cannot be changed (immutable)
