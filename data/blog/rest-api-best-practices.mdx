## Introduction

This article explores the best practices for REST APIs.
These practices provide a comprehensive guide to help you design and implement robust and scalable RESTful APIs.
Checkout the previous article [REST API](./rest-api-introduction) to get the basics of REST APIs.

## Use HTTP Methods Correctly

The HTTP methods are already explained in the previous article. Please check this article to get better understanding of [HTTP Methods](./rest-api-methods).
It's like the verbs of an API.

- `GET` - Retrieve a resource <br />
- `POST` - Create a resource <br />
- `PUT` - Update a existing resource entirely <br />
- `PATCH` - Update a resource partially <br />
- `DELETE` - Delete a resource <br />

## Use Nouns for Resources

In REST API, URI are used to identify the resources. The key thing is to focus on things not actions.
Instead of describing actions, describe what you want to do.

- Avoid actions
- Focus on resources
- Hierarchical URIs for nested resources

> The URL should represent what you are working with, The HTTP method represents what you are doing with it.

```
✅ Good: GET /api/v1/users
❌ Bad: GET /api/v1/getUsers
✅ Hierarchical-URI : GET /api/v1/users/123
```

## Use HTTP Status Codes Correctly

HTTP status codes are used to indicate the status of the request.

| Category | Range   | Meaning                 |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| 1xx      | 100-199 | Informational responses |
| 2xx      | 200-299 | Success responses       |
| 3xx      | 300-399 | Redirection responses   |
| 4xx      | 400-499 | Client-side errors      |
| 5xx      | 500-599 | Server-side errors      |

- 2xx (Success) : The request was successful
- 3xx (Redirection) : The request was redirected
- 4xx (Client-side errors) : The request was invalid
  - 429 Too Many Requests : The request was rate limited
- 5xx (Server-side errors) : The server-side error
  - 503 Service Unavailable : The server is temporarily unavailable

The below are the most commonly used status codes:

- 200 OK : Success
- 201 Created : Resource created
- 204 No Content : Sucess , no content to return
- 400 Bad Request : The request was invalid
- 401 Unauthorized : The request was unauthorized [Authentication required]
- 403 Forbidden : The request is forbidden [Authenticated user but doesn't have permission]
- 404 Not Found : The resource was not found
- 500 Internal Server Error - Server-side error

## Error Handling

The error handling helps to identify the issues in the request and to provide a better user experience.
For each request, the error handling should be done in the following order:

- Validate the request
- Check if the resource exists
- Check if the user has permission to access the resource
- Return the appropriate error code

## Versioning

The versioning is used to manage the different versions of the API.

There are 3 types of versioning:

- URI Versioning

```
GET /api/v1/users
GET /api/v2/users
```

- Header Versioning

```
GET /api/users
Accept-Version: v1

GET /api/users
Accept-Version: v2
```

- Query Parameter Versioning

```
GET /api/users?version=v1
GET /api/users?version=v2
```

## Pagination , Filtering and Sorting

### Pagination

Pagination breaks the large data into smaller chunks and returns the data in the chunks.

```
GET /api/users?page=1&limit=10
```

### Filtering

Filtering is used to filter the data based on the query parameters.

```
GET /api/users?role=admin
```

### Sorting

Sorting is used to sort the data based on the query parameters.

```
GET /api/users?sort=name&order=asc
```

## HATEOAS

HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) is a principle that states that the API should be hypermedia-driven.
It includes links in the response that guide the client to the next action. It makes the API more discoverable and easier to use.
It allows the client to navigate the API without knowing the exact URL.

```json
{
  "orderId": "1",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "total": 100,
  "items": [{ "productId": "P-1", "quantity": 2, "price": 50 }],
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/orders/1" },
    "payment": { "href": "/orders/1/payment" },
    "cancel": { "href": "/orders/1/cancel" },
    "customer": { "href": "/customers/1" }
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is used to limit the number of requests that can be made to the API.
This reduces the load on the server and improves the performance of the API.

### Common Rate Limiting Strategies

- Fixed Window Rate Limiting
- Sliding Window Rate Limiting
- Token Bucket Rate Limiting
- Leaky Bucket Rate Limiting
- Fixed Window Rate Limiting

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-Rate-Limit-Limit: 100 // Maximum requests allowed
X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 87 // Requests remaining
X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1605116036 // Time when the limit will be reset
```

## Caching

Caching is used to cache the response of the API.
This reduces the load on the server and improves the performance of the API.
