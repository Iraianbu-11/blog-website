# Introdution

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer** which is type of API that allows communication between systems over the internet.
REST API uses **HTTP** methods like **GET , PUT , POST , DELETE** to define actions that can be performed on resources.

# Client-Server Architecture

A client is any system that sends requests to the server. The server is responsible for processing the request from the client.
Let us consider as an example , the client (Browser) asks for the list of users to the server. The server process the client response.
It will check the database about the users and sends responses to the client. The Server can act as a client too. For example, if the database is
hosted in another server, the server now acts as client and request for the resource.

# API

API stands for **Application Programming Interface** is a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate and exchange between them. It defines the structure of the responses.
API acts as a middleman that enables applications to interact without the need of direct access.
REST API are widely used in communication.
