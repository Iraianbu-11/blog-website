# Introduction

**Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is an application layer protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers.
REST use standard HTTP methods to perform different operations on resources.
Resource represent a specific piece of data or object that can be accessed via a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier).

> [!NOTE]
> URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a general term for identifying a resource, while a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI that also provides the location of the resource.

# HTTP Methods

## GET

### Purpose : Retrieve data from the server

### Characteristics :

- Read-only operation
- Idempotent (Multiple requests have same effect as a single request)

```http
GET /api/v1/posts HTTP/1.1
Host : posts.com
```

### Best Practices :

- Use clear,hiearchical endpoints. For example :
  /users/:id to get details for specific user or /users to get details for all users.
- Do not include any sensitive information in the URL.
- Always return the right status codes :
  200 (OK)
  404 (Not found)

## POST

### Purpose : Create a new resource on the server

### Characteristics :

- Sends data in the request body
- Cannot be cacheable unless specified
- Not Idempotent

```http
POST /api/v1/posts HTTP/1.1
Host : posts.com
Content-Type : application/JSON

{
    "title" : "Introduction to REST API",
    "author" : "Iraianbu A"
}
```

### Best Practices :

- Validate the payloads before processing.
- Always return the right status codes :
  201 (Created)
  400 (Bad request)

## PUT

### Purpose: Update an existing resource or create it if it doesn't exist

### Characteristics:

- Idempotent
- Replaces the entire resource
- Requires the complete resource representation

```http
PUT /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "REST API - Methods",
  "author": "Iraianbu A",
}
```

### Best Practices :

- Make sure the request includes all the required fields.
- Don't use PUT for partial updates. Use PATCH instead.
- Always return the right status codes :
  200 (OK)
  404 (Not found)
  400 (Bad request)

## PATCH

### Purpose: Partially update an existing resource

### Characteristics:

- Modifies only specified fields
- Not necessarily idempotent
- More efficient than PUT when updating partial resources

### Best Practices :

- Ensure partial updates don't create inconsistencies (E.g) Updating the price should also update the tax amount.
- Always return the right status codes :
  200 (OK)
  204 (No content)
  404 (Not found)
  400 (Bad request)

```http
PATCH /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "REST API - HTTP Methods",
}
```

## DELETE

### Purpose: Remove a resource from the server

### Characteristics:

- Idempotent
- May return different status codes on subsequent calls

```http
DELETE /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
```

### Best Practices :

- Should always consider using soft deletes instead of hard deletes (E.g) Instead of deleting a user from the database, we can just mark it with deleted_at timestamp.
- Always return the right status codes :
  200 (OK)
  404 (Not found)

## OPTIONS

### Purpose: Get information about available communication options for a resource

### Characteristics:

- Often used for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) preflight requests
- Returns available methods and other capabilities

```http
OPTIONS /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
```

## HEAD

### Purpose: Get metadata about a resource without the body

### Characteristics:

- Similar to GET but without the response body
- Useful for checking resource availability and headers

```http
HEAD /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
```

## TRACE

### Purpose: Get the route and status of a resource

### Characteristics:

- Returns the request route and status
- Useful for debugging and diagnosing issues

```http
TRACE /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
```

## CONNECT

### Purpose: Establish a tunnel to the server

### Characteristics:

- Creates a secure tunnel for encrypted communication
- Useful for proxying and tunneling

```http
CONNECT /api/posts/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: posts.com
```

| Method | Idempotent | Safe | Cacheable |
| ------ | ---------- | ---- | --------- |
| GET    | Yes        | Yes  | Yes       |
| POST   | No         | No   | No        |
| PUT    | Yes        | No   | No        |
| PATCH  | No         | No   | No        |
| DELETE | Yes        | No   | No        |
