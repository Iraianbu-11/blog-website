## Introduction

**Encapsulation** is one of the four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It is the practice of **bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions)** that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class while restricting direct
access to the internal details of the class. It means wrapping the data (attributes) and methods (functions) together into a single unit.

Encapsulation can be achieved by:

- Access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`)
- Getters and setters
- Data Hiding

Encapsulation helps in **data protection** , **modularity** and **maintainability** of the code.

## Key Benefits

- Data Hiding : Prevent direct access to sensitive data.
- Increased Security : Controls how the data is accessed or modified.
- Improved Code Maintainability : Allows changes without affecting other parts of the code.
- Better Modularity : Allows the class to be used independently of other classes.

## Using Access Modifiers

We can use access modifiers to control the visibility of the data and methods.

## Using Getters and Setters

Encapsulation ensure that the data cannot be directly accessed but must be
retrieved or modified through methods.

## Data Hiding

Encapulsation helps in hiding the implementation details while exposing only necessary methods.

### Reason

1. Prevents direct modification
2. Ensures data integrity.

### Java

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    private String accountNumber;

    // Constructor
    public BankAccount(double balance, String accountNumber) {
        this.balance = balance;
        this.accountNumber = accountNumber;
    }

    // Getter method
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }

    // Setter method
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
        System.out.println("Deposited " + amount + " to account " + accountNumber);
    }

    public static void main(String... args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000, "1234567890");
        account.deposit(500);
        System.out.println("Balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

#### Output

```
Deposited 500.0 to account 1234567890
Balance: 1500.0
```

## Real world examples

1. Banking Applications - Protecting sensitive financial data.
2. Healthcare Applications - Protecting patient records.
3. E-commerce Platforms - Hiding payment processing details
